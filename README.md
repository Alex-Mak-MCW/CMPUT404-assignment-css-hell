Source
=================
I have used the source below to learn how to align 2 elements horizontally:

* Source Title: How to align two elements on the same line without changing HTML

Changes
=================
- Within the homepage directory, I added the HTML and CSS files to demonstrate the good and ugly pages.
- Within the gutenburg directory, I had erased some of the in-line CSS styles from the downloaded project gutenburg HTML files, and add more css in a separate CSS file named bookstyles.css
- I have added screenshots to demonstrate my pages in the root of this repository.
